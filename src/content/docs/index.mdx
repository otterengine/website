## Heads Up
All of the goals mentioned below are exactly that, **goals**. Some have not yet been realised,
others are only partially completed. For more info, go to the [Important Info](#important-information) section.

## Highlights

		Only use the features you need.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Usable" icon="pencil">
	  Otter aims to be **developer-friendly**, write your game logic in a way that makes **sense**.
		It is a major priority to prevent having to _worry_ about complex details, and instead focus on **creating something amazing**.
	</Card>

	  Otter is **open-source**, and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/otterengine/otter).
		On top of that, any and all suggestions will be considered. So, if you have any amazing ideas, please let us know!
	</Card>
	<Card title="Passion" icon="heart">

## Important Information

:::danger
Otter is currently nowhere near stable, let alone production ready.

This website documents features that are not yet finished,
or may not function at all.

Only use the project if you are fine with having to frequently migrate code to new APIs.
I will provide migration guides where possible, and hope to get the project to a stable state ASAP.
